# Walmart Voice Assistant 

**Walmart Voice Assistant** is an indoor, voice-enabled navigation web application designed to help users seamlessly navigate Walmart stores using voice commands. It supports not only visually impaired, physically or mentally challenged individuals, but also introverted and socially awkward users — promoting independence, comfort, and accessibility for all.

## Features

-  **Voice-Enabled Interface**: Navigate the store, search for products, and get assistance via voice.
-  **Indoor Navigation**: Helps users find aisles, products, and departments inside Walmart stores.
-  **Inclusive Design**: Made for everyone, especially those who are blind, disabled, introverted, or socially anxious.
-  **Real-Time Guidance**: Provides real-time responses and navigation support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)

##  How It Works

1. The app uses the **Web Speech API** to convert spoken queries into text.
2. It matches the spoken input with predefined navigation commands or product searches.
3. A dynamic in-store map and routing logic provides turn-by-turn guidance.
4. Voice feedback assists users throughout their journey.
